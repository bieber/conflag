Conflag
=======

conflag is a library for streamlined configuration loading from a
combination of built-in defaults, config files, and command-line
flags.  It's currently in a non-working state on its way to a new API
and implementation, for a working (but wholly different) version of
the library you can check out the v0.1 tag.

Installation
------------

`go get github.com/bieber/conflag`

Usage
